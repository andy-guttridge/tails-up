# Tails-up Cat Rescue

Tails-Up Cat Rescue is a site for a cat rescue/rehoming centre. The site is aimed at people who are interested in adopting a cat, and showcases a number of cats who need a home. It provides some key information about the personality, attributes and needs of each cat to enable potential adopters to work out whether they might be a suitable 'match'. It also features a form to put those interested in adopting in touch with the centre, and some further information for those new to cat ownership.

## Features 

The site features:

- A 'sticky' navigation bar at the top of the site to enable easy access to each section of the site. The title of the site is also displayed prominently in the navigation bar.
- An 'About' section, which provides some brief background information on the rescue centre and three taglines to explain why Tails-Up Cat Rescue would be a good choice for those looking to adopt a cat. Each tagline is illustrated with a cute cat picture to appeal to potential cat owners.
- A 'Cats looking for a home' section, which features a number of cats currently up for adoption. The name of each cat is provided with a heading, followed by an appealing photo of the catand a description written in the first 'person'.
- A 'Register' section, which provides the user with a form to complete to register their interest in adopting a cat. The form has required text/email fields requesting basic personal information (first name, last name and email address) and some radio buttons enabling the user to express some basic preferences about the sort of cat they are looking for and the home environment. The form also contains an optional field allowing the user to enter the names of any cats currently up for adoption if they are specifically interested in these.
- A 'Further information' section featuring an embedded Cat Society video providing some basic information for potential cat adopters.
- A footer with links to social media.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
